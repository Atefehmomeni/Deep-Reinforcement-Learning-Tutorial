# Welcome to the Deep Q-Network (DQN) Tutorial on CartPole-v1

This tutorial delves into Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically focusing on Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The objective is to provide a detailed understanding of DQN architecture, its interaction with the environment, and its learning process. The "CartPole-v1" game from the OpenAI Gym toolkit is used as the test environment.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Understanding of Reinforcement Learning**: Gain insights into the core principles of RL where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions to maximize cumulative rewards.
- **Deep Q-Network Mechanisms**: Explore how DQNs use deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function, which is essential for determining the optimal action-reward balance.
- **Experience with a Practical Application**: Apply these concepts in the CartPole-v1 environment, aiming to balance a pole on a moving cart.

## Introduction to Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q-Networks

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning in which an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment through actions and observations guided by rewards. RL differs from supervised learning as it doesn't rely on pre-labeled data but instead learns from the consequences of its actions.

Deep Q-Networks (DQN) integrate deep learning with traditional Q-learning, a model-free off-policy algorithm, enhancing its ability to handle complex, high-dimensional environments. Innovations such as experience replay and fixed Q-targets help stabilize the training process.

## About the CartPole-v1 Environment

CartPole-v1 is a well-known benchmark in RL provided by OpenAI Gym. The agent controls a cart that moves on a track with a pole hinged to it. The goal is to balance the pole by moving the cart left or right.

### State Variables:
- Cart position
- Cart velocity
- Pole angle
- Pole angular velocity

### Actions:
The agent can take two possible actions:
- 0: Move the cart to the left
- 1: Move the cart to the right

### Rewards:
The agent receives a reward of +1 for each timestep that the pole remains upright.

## Project Structure and Files

The repository is organized into several files:
- `DQNAgent.py`: Contains the class implementation of the DQN agent.
- `environment_setup.py`: Script to initialize and configure the CartPole-v1 environment.
- Additional utility scripts for training and evaluating the agent.

## How to Use This Repository

### Clone the Repository:
Clone this repository to your local machine to get started with the tutorial.

### Install Required Packages:
Ensure that you have Python installed and proceed to install the necessary packages using pip:
```bash
pip install gym tensorflow numpy
### Running the Simulation:
Execute the main script to start the training process and observe how the DQN agent learns to solve the CartPole problem.

## Key Parameters and Their Impact

- **Gamma (Discount Factor):** This parameter influences how much the agent prioritizes future rewards compared to immediate ones. It's crucial for tasks requiring long-term strategy.
- **Epsilon (Exploration Rate):** Balances exploring new actions and exploiting known information to maximize rewards. It starts high to encourage exploration and decays over time to allow more exploitation.
- **Learning Rate:** Determines how quickly the neural network adjusts its weights. A lower rate can lead to more stable but slower learning.
